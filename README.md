DESCRIPTION:

The Sports Club Management System is a database-driven application focused on efficient cricket club management, with a robust SQL Server backend defined in cricketmanagement.sql. The SQL database organizes data into 13 normalized tables, including sc_Club, sc_Player, sc_Matches, and sc_Injuries, with foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity. It features stored procedures like sp_RegisterPlayer and sp_GetTournamentMatches for secure data operations, and triggers such as trg_UpdatePlayerAvailability and trg_UpdateContractStatus to automate updates. Integrated with a Java Swing GUI, the system enables seamless management of player records, match schedules, and performance reports, making it a powerful tool for cricket administration.
